# sboxsoundscapetest
Testing S1 style soundscapes in s&amp;box<br>
To try it out yourself download this and put it in the addons folder and start map "soundscapetest"<br>
the map is just 1 soundscape, see it with the command "soundscape_debug 1"<br>
hopefully facepunch will remake soundscapes and we wont have to go thru this pain
